== Screenshots ==

1. Order summary column was removed in WooCommerce 3.0. Our plugin adds this column back. It will display contents of an order with variations. This makes order manamgenet easier and faster.

2. This option gives the easy way to manage order notes. Don’t needed to go to the order page anymore.

3. The frontend widget will help your buyers find their order by number. For an authorized user, a search is made for the orders that he made on the site. An unauthorized user will need to verify by e-mail. Also, the search form becomes available on the user’s order page.

4. Combining two or more orders into one. It will be useful when the user has made several orders in a short time with delivery to one address.

5. The new filter added to get orders that contain a certain product.

6. Very useful for sales experience. You can build the logic of your online store as you want. Add any intermediate steps between buying and shipping goods from the warehouse. Make colorful icons and you will not get lost in the interface.

7. The new tab in the admin panel of the plugin shows some useful sales statistics. It helps to know what products are the most popular in your e-shop, what customers bought most products (maybe to make a discount for them ;) ) and other useful charts. And you can range all this stuff by a time period to see more details.

8. These fields can be very helpful when troubleshooting issues. If customer complains that their checkout experience was not good you can see exactly what happened by testing it using same browser, operating system, etc. IP address can help with figuring out location of the customer.

9. You can set position of columns on the orders page the way you like. Can be helpful for some stores to make order management easier
